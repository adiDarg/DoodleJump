Your character is set in a world of platforms. Your goal is to get as far as possible.
If you fall under the bottom of the screen you lose.
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move between left and right.
Touching either of the walls will teleport you to the other side.
As your height increases the platforms will decrease in size until reaching a minimal height.
Some of the platforms will have springs on them.
Landing on the springs will launch you in the air,
giving you a much greater speed than a normal jump would.
The blue platforms are shifting from left to right,
They will become more frequent as you get higher.
The brown platforms will break after you jump on them.
You can pause at any point by pressing the ESCAPE button.
